this program will be able to tell how many day there is in a month based on user input for month and year.
I used 3 classes.
	* the first one, month, was used to get the user month input as an integer and turn in to the month in letter.
	for example, if the user wrote 11, the program will be able to retun november.
	if thhe user enter a number less than zero or greter than 12, the month is automatically became january.
	
	* the second class, MonthDays, was able to calculate how many days there is in a month. february was a challege
	because every 4 years is a leap year. therfore i had to write an algorithm that will tae leap year into consideration.
	
	* the last one was the public class with only the main method in it, calling the other class and recieving the user input.
