these are two separate program.

program 1 is a calculator, it recieve input from an user and calculate the result.
first the user give a number, it can be an integer or double. Then, the user enter an operator.
the only acceptable operators are ( + , - , * , / ). once revieved, the user is asked to enter their second number.
then the computer give the result.
ex:
enter your first number : [ 5 ]
enter an operator : [ + ]
enter your second number : [ 6 ]
6 + 5 = 11

if the user enter '%' character, they will recieved a message that the program is finished.

program 2 was a word counter. the computer count the words line by line. first it trim each line to make sure there is
 a equal blank space betwee each words. then it turned each word into an element of a array. then use array.lenght to
 count the words for each line. it add each line together to get the final counter.
